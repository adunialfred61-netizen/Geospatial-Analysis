## üìò Overview

This project presents the **mapping of the University of Ghana Main Campus** using field-collected GPS data and QGIS.  
The map was created to help **new students, visitors, and researchers navigate the campus easily** by providing a clear and accurate visualization of roads, buildings, and open spaces.

All data were collected manually using a handheld GPS, processed in **Excel**, and visualized in **QGIS**. The final output is a professionally designed campus map displaying major features such as roads, buildings, parks, and car parks.
